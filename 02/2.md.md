# Day 2 Corruption Checksum

## Part 1
Corrupted spreadsheet is being recovered. A spreadsheet consists of rows of apparently-random numbers. To make sure the recovery process is on the right track, need to calculate the spreadsheet's checksum.

For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value; the checksum is the sum of all of these differences.

Puzzle input in `input.txt`

### Examples
```
5 1 9 5
7 5 3
2 4 6 8
```
* The first row's largest and smallest values are 9 and 1, and their difference is 8.
* The second row's largest and smallest values are 7 and 3, and their difference is 4.
* The third row's difference is 6.
* Checksum would be `8 + 4 + 6 = 18`

### Method
* Read in 1 line at a time:
    * Find max and min values
    * Find difference
    * Add to result sum

## Part 2
Turns out the user only wanted information about the evenly divisible values in the spreadsheet.

On each line, find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other, divide them, and add up each line's result.

**Can assume there are only two numbers on each row which evely divide**

Puzzle input same as part 1

### Examples
```
5 9 2 8
9 4 7 3
3 8 6 5
```
* In the first row, the only two numbers that evenly divide are 8 and 2; the result of this division is 4.
* In the second row, the two numbers are 9 and 3; the result is 3.
* In the third row, the result is 2.
* Sum of the results would be `4 + 3 + 2 = 9`

### Method
* Simple (brute force)
* Read in 1 line at a time:
    * Find cartesian products of each row with itself:
        * ((x,y) for x in A for y in A)
    * Loop through products (x,y):
        * if x%y==0:
            * result += x/y
